# Face Recognition Project

This project uses OpenCV to implement facial recognition and track student attendance with date and time.

## Overview

Face recognition technology identifies and verifies a person from a digital image or video frame. Applications include security, access control, surveillance, and human-computer interaction.

### Goals

- **Face Detection**: Locate faces in images or video frames.
- **Face Alignment**: Normalize and align faces to a consistent orientation and size.
- **Feature Extraction**: Extract features from aligned faces to represent them as numerical vectors.
- **Face Recognition**: Match extracted features against a database of known faces to identify individuals.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Data Collection**: Gather a dataset of images or video frames with faces.
2. **Face Detection**: Use algorithms like Haar cascades or deep learning models to detect faces.
3. **Face Alignment**: Align detected faces using techniques like landmark detection.
4. **Feature Extraction**: Extract features using PCA, LBP, or CNNs.

## Face Database Creation

Create a database by extracting features from labeled images of each person.

## Face Recognition

Use algorithms like KNN or SVM to match test face features against the database.

## Evaluation and Tuning

Evaluate performance using metrics like accuracy and precision. Fine-tune by adjusting parameters or exploring advanced techniques like deep learning.

## Required Libraries and Tools

- **OpenCV**: For face detection and image processing.
- **Dlib**: For facial landmark detection and alignment.
- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing classification algorithms.
- **TensorFlow or PyTorch**: For advanced face recognition models.

## Usage

1. Install required libraries using pip or conda.
2. Collect a labeled dataset of faces.
3. Implement face detection, alignment, feature extraction, and recognition.
4. Train the model with the dataset.
5. Test the model with new images or video frames.
